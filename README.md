While this repository contains code used for my final 240 Project, not all models are loaded and the notebooks are preserved to show my coding progress so there are error as well as corrections that follow. 

Organization of Code:

w4_32825 File: This file shows the process of downloading brainscore and the models as well as the difficulties encounered trying to get past the pytorch wrapper applied to brainscore models

w5_040125 File: This file loads the top models and saves the activations of those models in a pkl file to later be accessed. This file also shows visualization of activations across layers for these top models across the brainscore categories.

w6_040325 File: This file does split halfs in order to get the best layer across multiple iterations, saving intermediates as well as plotting the final results.
